🚀 Abrar Mahabub — Web Developer

Hi! I'm **Abrar Mahabub**, a passionate web developer who loves crafting clean, responsive, and user‑friendly web experiences. I build modern web interfaces using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Tailwind CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **React**, and I manage my workflow with **Git & GitHub**.

🛠️ Technologies & Tools

Frontend Development

* HTML5 — semantic, accessible structures.
* CSS3 — modern layouts with Flexbox & Grid.
* Tailwind CSS — utility‑first, responsive UI design.
* JavaScript (ES6+) — dynamic and interactive web apps.
* React.js — component‑based UI development.

Version Control

* Git — branching, merging, CLI workflows.
* GitHub — collaboration, pull requests, project hosting.


🌟 What I Do

* Build responsive, mobile‑first websites
* Develop interactive UI components
* Create reusable React components
* Design clean, minimal and modern user interfaces with Tailwind
* Maintain optimized and scalable front‑end codebases


🚧 Current Focus

* Scaling my React knowledge
* Improving reusable UI component design
* Enhancing Tailwind CSS utilities and design systems
